This is a re creation of an pre existing project (https://github.com/antonioortegajr/Spider-Man-GoogleMap-with-Marvel-API) mapping locations in the Spider-Man (616)timeline.

Re doing the locations as this map feature from GitHub is neat and I need to review them all anyway as this data is pretty outdated.

Links to digital comics were added. These links were found via the Marvel API.

Icons from https://www.mapbox.com/maki/ were used.

Would be great to start another map for some character. Possibly a team like X-Men for Fantastic Four. Then merge all the json into one giant Marvel map. Should this get any interest or I will write some guidelines for the json.
