This is a re creation of an pre existing project (https://github.com/antonioortegajr/Spider-Man-GoogleMap-with-Marvel-API) mapping locations in the Spider-Man (616)timeline.

Places of interest in the life of The Amazing Spider-Man. Locations are based on Marvel.com when able. Others are from a map in the “Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe”. Plenty of help from SpiderFan.org and SpiderVillain.com. Some are based on their mention in various Spidey titles.
Locations are speculation unless otherwise noted with an official address of some sort. If you are even looking at this then you are most likely nerdy enough to know how to message me with any suggestions.

Re doing the locations as this map feature from GitHub is neat and I need to review them all anyway as this data is pretty outdated.

Links digital comics were added when applicable. These links were found via the Marvel API.

Icons from https://www.mapbox.com/maki/ were used.

Would be great to start another map for some character. Possibly a team like X-Men for Fantastic Four. Then merge all the json into one giant Marvel map. Should this get any interest or I will write some guidelines for the json.
