This is a re creation of an pre existing project (https://github.com/antonioortegajr/Spider-Man-GoogleMap-with-Marvel-API) mapping locations in the Spider-Man (616)timeline.

Re doing the locations as this map feature from GitHub is neat and I need to review them all anyway as this data is pretty outdated. Anchor tag ids are the API id for the the comic book issue referenced.

Places of interest in the life of The Amazing Spider-Man. Locations are based on Marvel.com when able. Others are from a map in the “Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe”. Plenty of help from the data collected at http://SpiderFan.org and http://SpiderVillain.com.

Some locations are events or based on some mention in various Spidey titles.

Many locations are speculation unless otherwise found in comic books.

Links digital comics were added when applicable. These links were found via the Marvel API found at http://developer.marvel.com/.

Icons from https://www.mapbox.com/maki/ were used.

Would be great to start another map for some character. Possibly a team like X-Men for Fantastic Four. Then merge all the json into one giant Marvel map. Should this get any interest or I will write some guidelines for the json.
