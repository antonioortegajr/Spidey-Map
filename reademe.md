This is a re creation of an pre existing project (https://github.com/antonioortegajr/Spider-Man-GoogleMap-with-Marvel-API) mapping locations in the Spider-Man (616)timeline.

Re doing the locations as this map feature from GitHub is neat and I need to review them all anyway as this data is pretty outdated.

Links to digital comics were added. this links were found via the Marvel API.
